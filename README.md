# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I decided to work on this project because I was curious. I wanted to get hands-on experience with Gitlab. The website I created is meant to be a clear and simple guide for users, especially those who are new to the subject, explaining what they can expect from the course.

While working on this project, I learned a bunch of new things that were a bit tricky to understand at first. But I'm happy with how far I've come, and I believe that with some more practice and discipline, I'll be able to understand everything even better.
